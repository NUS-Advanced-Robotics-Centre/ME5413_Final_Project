# Reflections

This is a list of reflections that I have encountered while working on this project. This list will be updated as I encounter more reflections.

## About `Exploration` (or `Mapping`)

I have one confusion about the `Exploration` (or `Mapping`) part: Am I required to design a randomly exploration policy? i.e. We can use the keyboard to control the robot to map the environment (By sending msgs to the `/cmd_vel` topic). But I am not sure if I am required to design a random exploration policy which could be used to map the environment without human intervention. (maybe more elegant and feasible)

## How do I qualitatively and quantitatively analyse the SLAM performance?

I found that there is no ground truth to compare the SLAM performance. So, how do I qualitatively and quantitatively analyse the SLAM performance? (generated by `Claude 3 Opus`)

### Qualitative Analysis

- Visual inspection of generated map: clarity, completeness, consistency
- Loop closure detection: success rate, global consistency, drift reduction
- Localization accuracy: estimated poses vs. expected positions, orientation consistency

### Quantitative Analysis

- Relative Pose Error (RPE): local consistency, RMSE or median error
- Map Quality Metrics:
  - Occupancy Grid Map: resolution, completeness, occupied/free space ratio
  - Point Cloud Map: density, distribution, nearest neighbor distances
- Computational Performance: runtime, memory usage, scalability
- Robustness and Reliability: performance in challenging scenarios, success rate
- Comparative Analysis: performance vs. well-known or state-of-the-art methods

### Presentation and Discussion

- Visualizations: maps, trajectories, error plots
- Strengths and weaknesses based on analysis
- Challenges encountered and proposed solutions
- Evaluation methodology, assumptions, and limitations
