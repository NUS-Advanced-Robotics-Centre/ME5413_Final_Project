# Reflections

This is a list of reflections that I have encountered while working on this project. This list will be updated as I encounter more reflections.

## About `Exploration` (or `Mapping`)

I have one confusion about the `Exploration` (or `Mapping`) part: Am I required to design a randomly exploration policy? i.e. We can use the keyborld to conrtol the robot the map the environment (By sending msgs to the `/cmd_vel` topic). But I am not sure if I am required to design a random exploration policy which could be used to map the environment without human intervention.
