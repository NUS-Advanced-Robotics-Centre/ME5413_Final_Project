## Go Through the Original Project

> 2024/03/15

I have forked the original project and gone through the original project description and instructions ([ORIGINAL_README.md](ORIGINAL_README.md)). I created the files [README.md](README.md), [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md), [REFLECTIONS.md](REFLECTIONS.md), and [ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md) to document my progress, thoughts, and reflections throughout this project.
