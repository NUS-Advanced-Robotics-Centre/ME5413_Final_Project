## Go Through the Original Project

+ 2024/03/15
  + I have forked the original project and gone through the original project description and instructions ([ORIGINAL_README.md](ORIGINAL_README.md)).
  + I created the files [README.md](README.md), [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md), [REFLECTIONS.md](REFLECTIONS.md), and [ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md) to document my progress, thoughts, and reflections throughout this project.

+ 2024/03/16
  + I have fixed the issues about the jackal models (`conda` env compatibility) and showing customised meshes in `Rviz` on `WSL2` (lower version of OpenGL).
  + I have initialized the `report_typ` folder.
